This Python project implements a spam detection system using:
- **Naive Bayes** classifier
- **TF-IDF** text vectorization
- **NLTK** for text preprocessing (stopword removal, stemming)

## Features:
- Loads and preprocesses SMS message data
- Trains a classification model to detect spam/ham messages
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy metrics
- Visualizes frequent spam words
- Saves trained model for future use
- Includes interactive prediction mode

## Requirements:
Python 3.x with pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn, and joblib
